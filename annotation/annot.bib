    annote    = {In this paper, the authors propose a a decomposition technology, dynamic mode decomposition(DMD), based on Koopman analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. This method extracted dynamic modes describe the global behavior captured from numerical and experimental data to project large-scale problems onto a reduced order dynamical system. Compare to proper orthogonal decomposition(POD), DMD directly applied on data and does not decomposite on orthogonal space. Schmid applied this frame on both numerical Navierâ€“Stokes code results and experimental measures and illustrated the significant essential on quantifying fluid-dynamical problems.}
