    annote  = {In this paper, the authors propose a decomposition technology, dynamic mode decomposition(DMD), based on Koopman analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. This method extracted dynamic modes describe the global behavior captured from numerical and experimental data to project large-scale problems onto a reduced order dynamical system. Compare to proper orthogonal decomposition(POD), DMD directly applied on data and does not decomposite on orthogonal space. Schmid applied this frame on both numerical Navier–Stokes code results and experimental measures and illustrated the significant essential on quantifying fluid-dynamical problems.\\ \\ At section 2, Schmid shows the initial idea of DMD algorithm which is usually called standard DMD in the following publications. Instead of employing QR-decomposition, he took advantage of SVD decomposition and obtain a robust approximation by $\tilde{S} = U^HV_2^NW\Sigma^{-1}$, where $V^{N-1}_1 = U\Sigma W^H$. The eigenvector $y_i$ of matrix $S$ and left eigenvector matrix U would be used to form the final dynamic modes $\phi_i$. Compare to the standard DMD, the tradition method use the least square solution to form matrix $S$ from QR-decomposition by $a = R^{−1}Q^Hv_N$, where $QR = V^{N-1}_1$. Also, some older attempts using Arnoldi method and Hessenberg matrix by $AQ \approx QH$ and $H = RSR^{−1}$ is not applicable because projections the matrix $A$ has to be available. Here $V^{N}_1 = \{v_1,Av_1,A^2v_1,…,A^{N-1}v_1 \} $ is the Krylov sequence based on the initial data snapshot $v_1$ and the linear map $A$ connect two snapshots ordered by sequence.      }

    annote  = {In this paper, the authors used DMD for produce a surrogate model based on two-dimensional full core data over six years and researched related uncertainties. They employed standard DMD(Algorithm I, Tu, 2014) to build the projections-based, reduced-order model. They defined the forward-sensitivity matrix $S = \phi ^{DMD} diag(e^{wt})\phi ^{DMD\dag}$ where $\omega= log(\lambda_i)/\Delta t$ and use the this and covariance matrix of initial condition $C_0$ to compute response
covariance by $C^{DMD} = SC_0S^{T}$. In the conclusion, they mention the DMD model has difficulty in catch the spatial dependent bias.}

	annote  = {Zhang and Wei used DMD modes and their adjoint modes to build simple Galerkin models in a low-order space. Traditional DMD has non-orthogonal bases which increase the difficulty in reducing the order of the model.  We can calculate adjoint DMD modes by $ \phi^{ad} = U (w^l) ^{*} $ where $w^l$ is the left eigenvector of $ \tilde{A} $. Then the projection of snapshot on adjoint modes is $a(i,t) = (x_t,\phi^{ad}_i)$. The variable could be expand by $a$ and stand DMD modes, which could be written as $u(x,t) = \sum^r_{i=0} a_i(t) \phi_i(x) $. Then we can project our governing equation by $(\phi^{ad},\frac{\partial u}{\partial t})$. Since there is natural bi-orthogonality between DMD modes and adjoint DMD modes $(\phi^{ad}_j,phi_i) = \delta$, the projection will lead to a sets of ODEs of $\frac{\partial a_i}{\partial t}$.   }
