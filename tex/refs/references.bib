	title = {A {Novel} {Solver} {Acceleration} {Technique} {Based} on {Dynamic} {Mode} {Decomposition}},
	abstract = {The speed-up of ﬁnite-volume solvers for compressible ﬂows is a diﬃcult task. There are several ways to achieve solver speed-up, more or less diﬃcult to implement and more or less suitable for implementation in a parallel, unstructured type of solver. Examples of such techniques are the multi-grid method and Implicit Residual Smoothening (IRSM). In this article, a solver acceleration technique based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is proposed. The technique does not depend on data format or mesh structure and is thus as straightforward to implement in an unstructured parallel code as in a structured sequential one. The main idea behind the proposed method is that it is possible to use the information available in ﬂow ﬁeld modes extracted using the DMD technique to ﬁnd a correction that will bring the solution closer to a steady-state condition, i.e. the method is only applicable to steady-state problems. In the presented work the proposed DMD-based acceleration technique has been implemented in a massively parallel block-structured ﬁnite-volume Navier-Stokes solver for compressible ﬂows. The method has been tested on a turbine cascade case with promising results. To the knowledge of the authors, the proposed method is not previously published in the open literature.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05241},
	abstract = {We present a novel acceleration technique for improving the convergence of source iteration for discrete ordinates transport calculations. Our approach uses the idea of the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to estimate the slowly decaying modes from source iteration and remove them from the solution. The memory cost of our acceleration technique is that the scalar ﬂux for a number of iterations must be stored; the computational cost is a singular value decomposition of a matrix comprised of those stored scalar ﬂuxes. On 1-D slab geometry problems we observe an order of magnitude reduction in the number of transport sweeps required compared to source iteration and that the number of sweeps required is independent of the scattering ratio in the problem. These observations hold for an extremely heterogeneous problem and a 2-D problem. In 2-D we do observe that the effectiveness of the approach slowly degrades as the mesh is reﬁned, but is still about one order of magnitude faster than source iteration.},

	abstract = {The decomposition of experimental data into dynamic modes using a data-based algorithm is applied to Schlieren snapshots of a helium jet and to time-resolved PIV-measurements of an unforced and harmonically forced jet. The algorithm relies on the reconstruction of a low-dimensional inter-snapshot map from the available ﬂow ﬁeld data. The spectral decomposition of this map results in an eigenvalue and eigenvector representation (referred to as dynamic modes) of the underlying ﬂuid behavior contained in the processed ﬂow ﬁelds. This dynamic mode decomposition allows the breakdown of a ﬂuid process into dynamically revelant and coherent structures and thus aids in the characterization and quantiﬁcation of physical mechanisms in ﬂuid ﬂow.},

	abstract = {Originally introduced in the ﬂuid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we deﬁne DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational eﬃciency and mitigate the eﬀects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deﬁcient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identiﬁcation method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

	abstract = {The integration of data and scientific computation is driving a paradigm shift across the engineering, natural, and physical sciences. Indeed, there exists an unprecedented availability of high-fidelity measurements from time-series recordings, numerical simulations, and experimental data. When data is coupled with readily available algorithms and innovations in machine (statistical) learning, it is possible to extract meaningful spatiotemporal patterns that dominate dynamic activity. A direct implication of such data-driven modeling strategies is that we can gain traction on understanding fundamental scientific processes and also enhance our capabilities for prediction, state estimation, and control of complex systems. The ability to discover underlying principles from data has been called the fourth paradigm of scientific discovery [131]. Mathematical techniques geared toward characterizing patterns in data and capitalizing on the observed low-dimensional structures fall clearly within this fourth paradigm and are in ever-growing demand.},

	abstract = {Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM) has become an indispensable tool for reducing the cost of repetitive executions common to Sensitivity Analysis (SA), Uncertainty Characterization (UC). Presented here is the application of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to build a data-driven, reduced-complexity surrogate that predicts the fuel concentration of a single TRIGA fuel element over time. The ultimate goal is to produce a surrogate for rapid determination of the composition of KSU TRIGA MARK II research reactor at any time within its forty years of operation. Such a surrogate would enable forward or inverse propagation of uncertainties from the initial fuel loadings and recent measurements, and enhance the current core model and reduce these uncertainties. The methodology was applied ﬁrst to single fuel elements to assess the reliability of the predictions when both testing and training data come from the same conﬁguration.The resulting surrogate was then tested with different initial conditions from a different fuel element. The tests verify that even with some perturbations of the initial conditions the DMD surrogate is able to predict the concentrations of the isotopes of interest. These single elements tests represent a ﬁrst step towards modeling the whole core and propagating uncertainties in the fuel composition over the 40 year period.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) was used to produce surrogates for the evolution of spatiallyvarying nuclide compositions in a TRIGA reactor. First, the method was explored by applying it to a single fuel element in which the data used was produced from the Polaris sequence in SCALE-6.2. Then the method was applied to a full core for which the data used to produce the surrogate was generated from a two-dimensional TRITON/NEWT model of a 78-element TRIGA core depleted over six full-power years. The surrogates have explicit time dependence and exhibited high accuracy for major nuclides in the problem studied. Then the analysis was extended to explore the propagation of time-dependent uncertainties in isotopic composition. The fuel element case showed potential where the full core generalization results revealed that the surrogates eigenpairs are sensitive to the perturbations in the data and hence failed to capture the whole space. Suggestions to address these difﬁculties were presented in the conclusion section.},

We propose an improvement to Newton’s method (NM) for solving the k-eigenvalue problem in transport theory that avoids costly within-group iterations or iterations over energy groups. We present a formulation of the k-eigenvalue problem where a nonlinear function, whose roots are solutions of the k-eigenvalue problem, is written in terms of a generic fixed-point iteration (FPI). In this way any FPI that solves the k-eigenvalue problem can be accelerated using the Newton approach, including our improved formulation. Calculations with a one-dimensional multigroup SN transport implementation in MATL AB provide a proof of principle and show that convergence to the fundamental mode is feasible. Results generated using a three-dimensional Fortran implementation of several formulations of NM for the well-known Takeda and C5G7-MOX benchmark problems confirm the efficiency of NM for realistic k-eigenvalue calculations and highlight numerous advantages over traditional FPI.},
