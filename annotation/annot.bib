    annote  = {In this paper, the authors propose a decomposition technology, dynamic mode decomposition(DMD), based on Koopman analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. This method extracted dynamic modes describe the global behavior captured from numerical and experimental data to project large-scale problems onto a reduced order dynamical system. Compare to proper orthogonal decomposition(POD), DMD directly applied on data and does not decomposite on orthogonal space. Schmid applied this frame on both numerical Navierâ€“Stokes code results and experimental measures and illustrated the significant essential on quantifying fluid-dynamical problems.}

    annote  = {In this paper, the authors used DMD for produce a surrogate model based on two-dimensional full core data over six years and researched related uncertainties. They employed standard DMD(Algorithm I, Tu, 2014) to build the projections-based, reduced-order model. They defined the forward-sensitivity matrix $S = \phi ^{DMD} diag(e^{wt})\phi ^{DMD\dag}$ where $\omega= log(\lambda_i)/\Delta t$ and use the this and covariance matrix of initial condition $C_0$ to compute response
covariance by $C^{DMD} = SC_0S^{T}$. In the conclusion, they mention the DMD model has difficulty in catch the spatial dependent bias.}
