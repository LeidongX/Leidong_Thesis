\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:intro}
Nuclear power was studied initially in 1940s and has become an important supply in power industry.
Without estimating the desired state of neutron population, it is impossible to control the neutronic systems and generate essential design. 
Computational simulation technology is critical in nuclear physics, which does not only used to optimize nuclear reactor design, but also help to understanding extremely complicated neutron dynamic behaviors.
However, to model a full core is an long-standing goal while it is still too computationally expensive to directly solve it even using the most advanced large-scale super computers. 
Therefore, having an efficient approach to obtain the criticality and neutron distribution accurately is a pivotal topic in this field.

\section{Operator Notation}
The generalized eigenvalue form of the neutron transport equation is a fundamental problem in computational reactor physics.
The dominant eigenvector and corresponding eigenvalue of this equation can represent if a system is in steady-state conditions.
Though criticality calculation arised from the analysis of time-dependent processes, it is sufficient to reduced transport equation in steady-state. 
Then the transport equation can be written in operator notation as
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{(I - DL^{-1}MS)} \mathbf{\phi} = \frac{1}{k} \mathbf{DL^{-1}MF} \mathbf{\phi}  \, ,
 \label{eq:keig}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{\phi} $ describes the scalar flux, $\mathbf{L}$ represents loss operator,  $\mathbf{F}$ represents fission operator, $\mathbf{S}$ represents the scattering operator, $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ represent moment-to-discrete and discrete-to-moment operators respectively, and the eigenvalue $k$ represents the ratio of gains to losses.
A reactor is "critical," i.e., the neutron population is steady, when $k = 1$; or "subcritical," i.e., the neutron density is decreasing as time passes when $k < 1$; or "supercritical," i.e., the neutron density is increasing with time when $k>1$.
The eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue $k$, which is usually known as fundamental (or dominant) eigenmode, indicates the scalar flux distribution when the system reach steady state.
A more generalized multigroup neutron transport equation will be represented in Chapter 2.

\section{Motivation and Objective}
Discrete ordinates method is a practical deterministic approach that used to solve Equation \ref{eq:keig}.
This approach is often smoothed by other iterative method, like power method, Richard iteration method and GMRES, and will apply the loss operator $L$ every iteration.
Numerically, we don't solve directly inverse the operator, and would sweeping over each energy group and space location until the system converges instead.  
However, it will still cost the enormous computational resource when it requires a large amount number of iterations. 
Many breakthrough, such as the Generalized Davidson(GD) method and Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration(DSA), came to accelerate those iteration methods.

Within the development of computational science，some theory of data science has been employed to analyze engineering problems.
Dynamic mode decomposition(DMD) was one of the most well-known supervised learning approach that has achieved great success in computational fluid dynamics.
This data-driven technology could produce reduced-dimensional surrogate model by gathering modes from given states of the time series and reconstructing the output parameters.
The primary focus of this dissertation is to estimate a more accurate fundamental eigenmodes by DMD to accelerate power and related methods.

To achieve these goals, a reviews of applications of DMD will be described in the rest of Chapter 1.
Chapter 2 will introduce the multigroup neutron transport and diffusion equation, and Chapter 3 discuss the mathematically background of power and flatten power method.
Following that, DMD-PM(n) are presented in Chapter 4, while DMD-FPM(n) are presented in Chapter 5.
Then, the results and further analysis of the 1-D and 2-D test problems are described in Chapter 6.
Chapter 7 will include conclusions and future work including possibility to combine this theory with other methods. 


\section{Summary of previous work}
Before continuing, it would be useful to brief introduce some great achievements that demonstrated the success of dynamic mode decompositio
DMD was initially proposed by Schmid to extract dynamics information from time-series data of fluids observations.\cite{schmid_dynamic_2010}\cite{schmid_applications_2011}
Schmid proposed a decomposition technology, dynamic mode decomposition(DMD), based on Koopman analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. 
This method extracted dynamic modes describe the global behavior captured from numerical and experimental data to project large-scale problems onto a reduced order dynamical system. 
Compare to proper orthogonal decomposition(POD), DMD directly applied on data and does not decomposite on orthogonal space. 
Schmid applied this frame on both numerical Navier-Stokes code results and experimental measures and illustrated the significant essential on quantifying fluid-dynamical problems.
Schmid shows the initial idea of DMD algorithm which is usually known as standard DMD algorithm in the subsequent publications. 
Instead of employing QR-decomposition, he took advantage of SVD decomposition and obtain a robust approximation by $\tilde{S} = U^HV_2^NW\Sigma^{-1}$, where $V^{N-1}_1 = U\Sigma W^H$. 
The eigenvector $y_i$ of matrix $S$ and left eigenvector matrix U would be used to form the final dynamic modes $\phi_i$. Compare to the standard DMD, the tradition method use the least square solution to form matrix $S$ from QR-decomposition by $a = R^{−1}Q^Hv_N$, where $QR = V^{N-1}_1$. 
Also, some older attempts using Arnoldi method and Hessenberg matrix by $AQ \approx QH$ and $H = RSR^{−1}$ is not applicable because projections the matrix $A$ has to be available. 
Here $V^{N}_1 = \{v_1,Av_1,A^2v_1,…,A^{N-1}v_1 \} $ is the Krylov sequence based on the initial data snapshot $v_1$ and the linear map $A$ connect two snapshots ordered by sequence.  

Tu and Kutz posted mathematical analysis of DMD algorithm and further extension including Extract DMD.  \cite{tu_dynamic_2014}
They also summarized many other fashion variety DMD algorithms, such as mrDMD and DMDc, and discuss the applicability fitting with different complex systems.\cite{kutz_dynamic_2016}
Fundamental theoretical foundations of DMD and the Koopman operator was also developed in this book.

\subsection{DMD in Nuclear Engineering}
Soon after, this technology then was applied in nuclear reactor simulation. 
Abdo and others used DMD as a direct, explicit-in-time surrogate for such black-box models, e.g., to model the evolution of nuclear reactor isotopics over long time periods; and the nonlinear response of reactor power during short transients.\cite{abdo_data-driven_2018}\cite{abdo_modeling_2019}\cite{elzohery2018comparison}

\subsection{DMD Acceleration}
A way to achieve acceleration is to use results from lower dimensional system projected system to find a correction each iteration until system converges.
The first research of using DMD to accelerate iterative methods was the work of Andersson and Eriksson.\cite{andersson_novel}
A Krylov subspace is built up by store the states samples with time sequence as $V_n$, then Gram-Schmidt algorithm is applied by $V_n = E_n U_n$.
The reason why authors would not like to use SVD is that Gram-Schmidt algorithm only work with two state vectors each time and SVD requires the whole subspace matrix $V_n$. 
Moreover, Gram-Schmidt algorithm is obviously a more suitable approach for parallel computations. 
The reduced projection of the system matrix $\tilde{A}$ is obtained by $\tilde{A} = E_n^T V_{n+1} U_n^{-1}$, and is implemented into iterative linear relation $\mathbf{x}^{(n+1)} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}^{(n)} + \mathbf{b}$.
The estimate of the converged solution can be calculate in the modified form as:
\begin{equation}
 x^{u} = x^{(n+1)} + E_n(I_n - \tilde{A}_n)^{-1} E_n^T(x^{(n+2)} - x^{(n+1)}) \, ,
 \label{eq:andersson}
\end{equation}
By performing this process several time to correct the solution, both the number of iterations and the average fluctuation was reduced almost 30\% for compressible flow problems. 

McClarren present a novel acceleration technique for improving the convergence of Richardson(source) iteration for source-driven neutronics problems.\cite{mcclarren_acceleration_2018}
The Richardson iteration can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{x}^{(n+1)} = (\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})\mathbf{x}^{(n)} + \mathbf{b} \, ,
 \label{eq:richardson}
\end{equation}
where sequence of $\mathbf{x}^{(n)}$ was often saved to build Krylov subspace. 
However, a great feature in his modified DMD acceleration algorithm is that a set successive differences $\mathbf{x}^{(n)}-\mathbf{x}^{(n-1)}$ is used as the columns in the data matrix $Y_+$ and $Y_-$ while the standard DMD with SVD decomposition is applied to form the approximation system $\tilde{A}$.
The algorithm is as follows
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Perform R source iterations: $\phi^{l} = A \phi^{l-1} +b$
 \item Compute K source iterations to form $Y_+$ and $Y_-$. The last column of $Y_-$ we call $\phi^{K-1}$ 
 \item Compute $\phi = \phi^{K-1} + U \Delta y$.
\end{enumerate} 
Here, $U$ is the left unitary matrix from SVD decomposition of $Y_-$ and $\Delta y$ is computed by 
\begin{equation}
 (I - \tilde{A}) \Delta y = U^T(\phi^{K} - \phi^{K-1})\, ,
 \label{eq:McClarren}
\end{equation}
Results from a homogeneous slab problem and a multi-dimensional pip problem suggest that a sequence of Richardson iterations followed by corrections reduces the number of iterations required by about one order of magnitude.

All of these past successes shows that DMD has potential to estimate the converged dominant modes of a reactor system by extrapolating forward from observed snapshots, even though the sequence of iterations from power method does not means "real time".
